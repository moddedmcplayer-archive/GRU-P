# GRU-P
An EXILED plugin that adds the GRU-P team for SCPSL.

Spawns when the ticket difference between mtf and chaos is under a specific amount.

Replace Chaos Keycard with 'GRU-P-Keycard' in config to use it instead.
(Same access as CI Keycard, just uses a Facility Manager)

Suggest stuff/bugs in issues.
